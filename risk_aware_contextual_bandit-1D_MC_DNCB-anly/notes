OPTIMIZE 2 METRICS OPTION:
landa = leave at 2.5
alpha = leave at 0.5

landa and alpha don't matter to policy loss because we are not concerned with
risk.
We simply iteratively sum the single critic policy loss expression for each critic (miss
distance and time.), and take the mean of summed losses.

They also don't matter to critic loss because it does not contain alpha, and
there are no constraints (and hence landa doesn't matter).
get_objective returns reward for each critic pass.

This means reward must return 2 values (miss distance and time to impact)

OPTIMIZE TIME, MITIGATE RISK TO MISSING
